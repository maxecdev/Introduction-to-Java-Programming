### Sphere Calculations.

This program is used to calculate the surface area and volume from the radius.
Things to keep in mind:
  ·The surface area of ​​a sphere is calculated as follows: 4*pi*(r^2).
  ·To calculate the volume of a sphere from the radius it is (4/3)*pi*(r^3).
  ·There are 1000 liters per cubic meter.
